The computer is connected to an external device that can interrupt the processor asynchronously. The processor needs to execute the interrupt service routine (ISR) to serve this interrupt. The following steps (not necessarily in order) are taken by the processor when the interrupt arrives: (i) The processor saves the content of the program counter. (ii) The program counter is loaded with the start address of the ISR. (iii) The processor finishes the present instruction. Which ONE of the following is the CORRECT sequence of steps?",
