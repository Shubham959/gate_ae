In-vessel composting systems can be divided into plug flow and agitated bed modes.

In an agitated bed system, composting material is mixed mechanically during the processing. The heat produced in aquatic composting cause any surplus moisture to be extracted as water vapour and hence no leachate is produced. Actinomycetes are aerobic, spore forming positive bacteria.

Assume that when one characteristic is changed, all other characteristic remain fixed. Effect of increase in filter depth (L) [latex]T_{B}[/latex] : [latex]T_{B}[/latex] will increase since particles in water will have the opportunity to potentially interact with more collectors, and hence the change for particle attachment to a collector is more.

Effect of increase in superdicial velocity ([latex]V_{s}[/latex]) [latex]T_{B}[/latex]: Since pore velocity is more, the shear forces experianced by collected particles will be more. Hence particle detachment will be more, leading to a decrease in [latex]T_{B}[/latex]. [latex]T_{H}[/latex]: Since particle loading rate on the filter and rate of particle collection in the filter will increase, the porosity of the filter bed will decrease more rapidly, leading to more rapid head-loss buildup and hence a decrease in [latex]T_{H}[/latex]. Effect of increase in influent particle concentration ([latex]C_{o}[/latex]) [latex]T_{B}[/latex]: Particle loading rate on the filter, rate of particle collection and hence porosity of the filter bed will decrease more rapidly. Thus pre velocity in the filter bed will increase more rapidly, leading to more rapid particle detachment. This will lead to decrease in [latex]T_{B}[/latex]. [latex]T_{H}[/latex]: Since particle loading rate on the filter and rate of particle collection in the filter will be increase, the porosity of the filter bed will decrease more rapidly, leading to more rapid head-loss buildup and hence a decrease in [latex]T_{H}[/latex]. Effect of increase in floc strength [latex]T_{B}[/latex]: Particle detachment due to shear force will become less prominent leading to increase in [latex]T_{B}[/latex]. [latex]T_{H}[/latex]: Since particle retention in the filter will be more, the porosity of the filter bed will decline faster leading to faster buildup of head-loss and hence [latex]T_{H}[/latex] will decrease. Effect of increase in collector diameter (d) [latex]T_{B}[/latex]: Increase in collector diameter will mean the presence of a lesser number of collector in the filter media. This will result is lesser number of potential interaction between a particle and a collector. Thus [latex]T_{B}[/latex] is expected to decrease. [latex]T_{H}[/latex]: Since lesser number of particle will be collected as mentioned above, the rate of head-loss buildup will be lower, leading to increase in [latex]T_{H}[/latex]. Effect of increase in porosity ([latex]\\alpha [/latex]) It must be realized that the porosity of the filter media does not depend on particle size, but on grading of particles. Well-graded sand, i.e., with a broader particle size distribution will have less porosity, as compared to poorly graded sand with a narrower particle size distribution. [latex]T_{B}[/latex] : In case poorly graded sand (with more porosity) is used as the filter media, the influent particles will potentially encounter lesser number of collectors and will not be collected efficiently.Hence [latex]T_{B}[/latex] will decrease. [latex]T_{H}[/latex]: Increase in porosity of sand and poor particle collection as described above will result in lower rate of head-loss buildup and hence increase in [latex]T_{H}[/latex]. Effect of non-addition of coagulant [latex]T_{B}[/latex]: If no coagulants are added, the particles will be stable and hence will not attach efficiently to the filter media. Hence [latex]T_{B}[/latex] will decrease. [latex]T_{H}[/latex]: Since rate of particle clollection in the filter media will be lower as described above, the rate of head-loss buildup will also be lower, leading to an increase in [latex]T_{H}[/latex].",
