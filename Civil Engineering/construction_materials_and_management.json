If so, the target mean strength would be the same as this characteristic strength, and standard deviation or quality control level wouldn't change it. Hence, under this hypothetical condition, the statement is valid. This statement is correct. Statement (B): The Ten Percent Fines Value (TPFV) is expressed in units of force (typically kN), so it is not non-dimensional. This statement is incorrect. Statement (C): For longer durations of loading, concrete exhibits more creep and deformation. Therefore, the secant modulus for 1-day loading is smaller than that for a 10-minute duration. This statement is correct. Statement (D): Increasing the carbon content in steel increases its strength, including the 0.2% proof stress, though it may reduce ductility and weldability.

The shape (cube vs. cylinder) and size of a specimen affect the test results due to variations in stress distribution and failure patterns. Option B: Air-dried and saturated test specimens show the same compressive strength for concrete. This is false. Air-dried specimens typically show higher compressive strength compared to saturated ones because excess moisture can weaken the internal structure during loading. Option C: Curing conditions, such as temperature and relative humidity, can influence the compressive strength of concrete. This is true. Proper curing ensures complete hydration and strength development, while poor curing can reduce final strength. Option D: Compressive strength depends on the water-to-binder ratio used in the concrete mixture. This is true.
