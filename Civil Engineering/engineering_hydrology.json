[latex]\\text{Drainage Density} = \\frac{\\text{Total Length of Streams}}{\\text{Catchment Area}}[/latex] Effect on Runoff and Hydrograph: A higher drainage density means that water reaches the outlet faster, leading to a sharper and higher peak in the flood hydrograph and a shorter time base. A lower drainage density implies that water takes longer to concentrate, causing a broader hydrograph with a lower peak and a longer time base. Statement (A): This is incorrect. Lower drainage density leads to lower, not higher, flood peaks. Statement (B): Correct. Lower drainage density causes slower concentration of runoff and hence a lower peak in the hydrograph.

    "solution": "Permeability = Hydraulic conductivity [latex]\\left ( \\frac{\\mu }{\\rho g} \\right )[/latex] A storm of i=0.5 cm/hr occurs over the soil for an indefinite period. What is the meaning of \"indefinite period\"? In order to achieve steady state condition, continuous application of water is necessary so that the water level is maintained constant. 'Surface drainage adequate' means at steady state condition some water flows as surface runoff. 'Storm has lasted for a very long time' means the hydraulic conductivity approaches saturated hydraulic conductivity (so that Darcy's law can be obeyed) and at steady state condition infiltration rate is also constant. The constant infiltration rate which is achieved after very long time, shall be more than 0.2 cm/hr (as hydraulic conductivity has increased) but should be less than storm intensity 0.5 cm/hr due to adequate drainage.",
