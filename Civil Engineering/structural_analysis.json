Identify the CORRECT influence line from the following options: Note: Positive value corresponds to tension and negative value corresponds to compression in the member.",
    "solution": "To determine the correct influence line for axial force in member GL: Step 1: Member G-L is a diagonal member connecting the bottom chord joint G to the top chord joint L. It is part of a vertical and diagonal web system in a pin-jointed truss. Step 2: Apply a unit moving load on the bottom chord and analyze the influence of this load on the axial force in member G-L. When the unit load is directly under joint G, it induces the maximum positive influence (tension) in member G-L. When the unit load is under joint L, it causes a negative influence (compression). Between G and L, the influence is linear due to statically determinate nature of the truss and linear response of the system. Outside G and L (i.e., A-G and L-P), the influence is zero since the load does not affect the member significantly.
