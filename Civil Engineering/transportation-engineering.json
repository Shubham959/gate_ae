    "solution": "As per IRC [latex]86: 2018[/latex] Clause 8.6 Widening of Carriageway on Curves: At sharp horizontal curves, it is necessary to widen the carriageway to provide for safe passage of vehicles. The widening required has two components: (i) mechanical widening to components for the extra width occupied by a vehicle on the curve due to tracking of the rare wheels, and (ii) psychological widening to permit easy crossing of vehicles since vehicles in a lane tend to wander more on a curve than on a straight reach. On two-lane or wider roads, it is necessary that both the above components should be fully catered for so that the lateral clearance between vehicles of curves is maintained equal to the clearance available on straight. Position of single-lane roads however is somewhat different. Since during crossing maneuvers outer wheels of vehicles have in any case to use the shoulder whether on the straight or on the curve. It is, therefore sufficient on single lane roads if only the mechanical component of widening is taken into account. Based on the above considerations, the extra width of carriageway to be provided at horizontal curves on single and two-lane roads is given in Table For multi-lane roads, the pavement widening may be calculated by adding half the widening for two-lane roads to each lane.
