Step 2: Evaluating the Given Options Option (A):  A^T = A⁻¹  - This statement says that the transpose of  A  is its inverse.\n- In general, a symmetric matrix  A  satisfies  A^T = A , but there is no guarantee that  A^T = A⁻¹ .\n- This is true only if  A  is an **orthogonal matrix**, which is not given in the problem.\n- Thus, this statement is incorrect. Option (B):  AB = BA  - In general, two symmetric matrices **do not necessarily commute**.\n- That is,  AB \\ne  BA  in most cases.\n- Thus, this statement is incorrect. Option (C):  (AB)^T = B^T A^T  - Using the property of transposition:  \n   (AB)^T = B^T A^T  - Since  A  and  B  are symmetric, we substitute  A^T = A  and  B^T = B :  \n   (AB)^T = B A  - This matches the given statement.\n- Thus, this statement is correct. ✅ Option (D):  A = A⁻¹  - A matrix satisfying  A = A⁻¹  is called an **involutory matrix**.\n- However, not all symmetric matrices satisfy this property.\n- The problem does not state that  A  is involutory.\n- Thus, this statement is incorrect.

    "image": null,
    "solution": "Concept: Balancing of rotating and reciprocating masses is essential in machines to reduce vibrations and improve performance and life. Rotating Masses: Rotating masses can be balanced by adding counter masses. A rigid rotor unbalanced in space (not just in one plane) needs to be balanced in both magnitude and direction in 3D. Reciprocating Masses: Reciprocating masses (like in single-cylinder IC engines) cannot be perfectly balanced because of the nature of reciprocating motion—only partial balancing is possible. Step 1: For a rigid rotor, full dynamic balance (i.e., both force and couple balance) requires placing two balancing masses in two distinct planes. So, option (A) is incorrect—a single balancing mass cannot balance both force and couple. Step 2: A single-cylinder engine produces unbalanced reciprocating inertia forces. It is not possible to completely balance all forces and couples with just masses. Hence, options (C) and (D) are incorrect. Final Answer: ✅ Correct option: (B)",

    "image": null,
    "solution": "Option (A): In laminar flow, the velocity profile is parabolic:  V\\text{avg} = (1/2) V\\text{max}  In turbulent flow, the velocity profile is flatter, so:  V\\text{avg} \\approx 0.8 , V\\text{max}  Therefore, for the same maximum velocity, the average velocity is higher in turbulent flow. This statement is correct. Option (B): Compressibility effects are generally considered negligible for Mach number  M < 0.3 . They become significant when  M ≥q 0.3 . Hence, this statement is incorrect. Option (C): For laminar flow, the Darcy friction factor is given by:  f = (64/Re)  This formula shows that friction factor depends only on Reynolds number and not on surface roughness. So this statement is correct. Option (D): Since  f = (64/Re) , as Reynolds number decreases, the friction factor increases. Therefore, the statement that friction factor decreases with decrease in Reynolds number is incorrect.",

Step 1: Simplify the denominator  (z^2 + 4)(z^2 - 4) = (z^2 + 4)(z - 2)(z + 2)  So the integrand becomes:  (z^3/(z - 2)(z + 2)(z^2 + 4))  Step 2: Identify singularities (poles) Poles of the function are at:  z = 2, \\quad z = -2, \\quad z = 2i, \\quad z = -2i  Step 3: Determine which poles lie inside the unit circle The unit circle is  |z| = 1 . All poles lie outside the unit circle because:  |2| = 2 > 1,\\quad |-2| = 2 > 1,\\quad |2i| = 2 > 1,\\quad |-2i| = 2 > 1  So, there are no poles inside the contour. Step 4: Apply Cauchy's Theorem Since the integrand is analytic inside and on the contour, the integral is zero:  \\oint_C (z^3/(z^2 + 4)(z^2 - 4)) , dz = 0  Compare with the given expression:  2\\pi i n = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad n = 0  Final Answer:  \\boxed{n = 0.0}",

The probability of P losing or drawing a match doesn't affect the outcome for P winning, so we focus only on the probability of winning. Step 2: We can model the number of wins as a binomial distribution, where the number of trials is 3 (the number of matches) and the probability of success (P winning) is 0.80. Step 3: The probability of P winning exactly 2 matches out of 3 is given by the binomial probability formula:  P(X = 2) = \\binom{3}{2} (0.80)^2 (0.20)^1  Where  \\binom{3}{2}  is the number of ways to choose 2 wins from 3 matches.

Let's calculate this constant using the difference between the positions of the letters and their corresponding code values. HIDE: - H = 8  →  19, the difference is  19 - 8 = 11  - I = 9  →  23, the difference is  23 - 9 = 14  - D = 4  →  7, the difference is  7 - 4 = 3  - E = 5  →  11, the difference is  11 - 5 = 6  Final Answer: Based on this calculation, we would need to apply the same pattern to the word \"HIGH\". For H = 8  →  19 For I = 9  →  23 For G = 7  →  17 For H = 8  →  19",

    "image": null,
    "solution": "Given: We need to identify the correct sequence of objects arranged in the increasing number of mirror lines (lines of symmetry). Step 1: Let's analyze the number of mirror lines for each shape: Circle: A circle has infinite lines of symmetry because it can be reflected along any line passing through its center. Square: A square has 4 lines of symmetry: 2 diagonals and 2 midlines (vertical and horizontal). Equilateral Triangle: An equilateral triangle has 3 lines of symmetry: one along each of its altitudes. Isosceles Triangle: An isosceles triangle has 1 line of symmetry, which divides the triangle into two congruent parts.",

Based on her interview performance, she estimates the probability of receiving job offers from companies S and T to be 0.8 and 0.6, respectively. Let p be the probability that she receives job offers from both the companies. Select the most appropriate option.",
    "image": null,
    "solution": "The probability of receiving job offers from both companies,  p , is the intersection of the two events. Using the formula for the intersection of two events, we know:  P(S \\cap T) = P(S) + P(T) - P(S \\cup T)  The maximum value of  P(S \\cup T)  is 1, as the probability of the union cannot exceed 1. Thus, the maximum possible value for  p  is:  p\\text{max} = P(S) + P(T) - 1 = 0.8 + 0.6 - 1 = 0.4  The minimum value of  p  occurs when the two events are mutually exclusive, i.e., there is no overlap between the two events. In this case, the minimum value of  p  is 0. Thus, the probability  p  lies in the range:  0 ≤q p ≤q 0.4",
