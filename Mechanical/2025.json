Step 1: Analyze Joint B At joint B, the following members are connected: • BA (inclined) • BC (inclined) • BD (horizontal) There is no external load or support at joint B . Therefore, the standard zero-force member rules cannot directly eliminate any member here. Step 2: Analyze Load Path The applied load [latex]F = 1000 \\text{N}[/latex] is acting horizontally at point A. This load is transmitted from A to D (vertical support) and A to B. So, member BA will carry some force to maintain equilibrium at joint A. Step 3: Analyze Joint D At joint D, the following members are connected: • AD (vertical) • CD (horizontal) • BD (diagonal) Since support reactions are present at D, members AD and CD can balance vertical and horizontal loads respectively. There is no need for force to pass through BD to maintain equilibrium. Step 4: Conclusion As member BD does not contribute to the equilibrium of any joint and is not needed to transmit force: BD is a zero-force member. Final Answer: BD",

    "solution": "Concept: Balancing of rotating and reciprocating masses is essential in machines to reduce vibrations and improve performance and life. Rotating Masses: Rotating masses can be balanced by adding counter masses. A rigid rotor unbalanced in space (not just in one plane) needs to be balanced in both magnitude and direction in 3D. Reciprocating Masses: Reciprocating masses (like in single-cylinder IC engines) cannot be perfectly balanced because of the nature of reciprocating motion—only partial balancing is possible. Step 1: For a rigid rotor, full dynamic balance (i.e., both force and couple balance) requires placing two balancing masses in two distinct planes. So, option (A) is incorrect—a single balancing mass cannot balance both force and couple. Step 2: A single-cylinder engine produces unbalanced reciprocating inertia forces. It is not possible to completely balance all forces and couples with just masses. Hence, options (C) and (D) are incorrect. Final Answer: ✅ Correct option: (B)",

If they play 3 more matches, we need to find the probability of P winning exactly 2 out of these 3 matches. Step 1: The probability of P winning a match is [latex] P(\\text{win}) = 0.80 [/latex]. The probability of P losing or drawing a match doesn't affect the outcome for P winning, so we focus only on the probability of winning. Step 2: We can model the number of wins as a binomial distribution, where the number of trials is 3 (the number of matches) and the probability of success (P winning) is 0.80. Step 3: The probability of P winning exactly 2 matches out of 3 is given by the binomial probability formula: [latex] P(X = 2) = \\binom{3}{2} (0.80)^2 (0.20)^1 [/latex] Where [latex] \\binom{3}{2} [/latex] is the number of ways to choose 2 wins from 3 matches.
