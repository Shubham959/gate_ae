    "solution": "Types of allowances: Draft/taper allowances. Machining allowance/finishing allowance. Distortion allowances/camber allowance Shrinkage allowance/contraction allowances. Shake allowance/rapping allowance. Shake allowance Before withdrawal from the sand mould, the pattern is wrapped all around the vertical faces to enlarge the mould cavity slightly, which facilitates its removal. Since it enlarge the final casting made, it is desirable that the original pattern dimensions should be reduced to account for this increase. There is no sure way of quantifying this allowance, since it is highly dependent on the foundry personnel and practices involved. It is negative allowance and is to be applied only to those dimensions, which are parallel to the parting plane. One way of reducing this allowance is to increase the draft, which can be removed during the subsequent matching. Draft/taper allowances Once pattern is embedded in the moulding sand now it is required to withdrawing the pattern from moulding sand, for this propose a vertical force is required to lift the pattern. For easy removal of pattern from mould cavity there should be some degree or [latex]\\mathrm{mm}[/latex] taper in the pattern. If there is no taper in the pattern then more chance to break the mould cavity wall during withdrawing the pattern. Draft allowance varies with the complexity of job. Machining or Finishing allowance In sand casting operation machining/finishing allowances is given in the pattern as on solidification every metal get shrinked up to some extend and the outer surface of object (casting) is rough, therefore, to smoothing the outer surface of casting machining allowance is must. Distortion allowance/Camber allowance On just solidification of metal casting is weak, therefore, more chances to distorted casting. Chance of distortion are basically in [latex]U, V[/latex], then long section or complicated casting. Distortion can be minimized or eliminated by providing an allowance and constructed the pattern initially distorted, i.e. opposite in outer side direction. Among of distortion allowance varies from 1.5[latex]20 \\mathrm{~mm}[/latex].

    "solution": "Surface Treatments: During machining operations,small scratches\nand grooves are invariably introduced into the\nworkpiece surface by cutting tool action. These\nsurface markings can limit the fatigue life. It has\nbeen observed that improving the surface finish by\npolishing will enhance fatigue life significantly. One of the most effective methods of increasing\nfatigue performance is by imposing residual\ncompressive stresses within a thin outer surface\nlayer. Thus, a surface tensile stress of external\norigin will be partially nullified and reduced in\nmagnitude by the residual compressive stress. The\nnet effect is that the likelihood of crack formation\nand therefore of fatigue failure is reduced. Residual compressive stresses are commonly\nintroduced into ductile metals mechanically by\nlocalized plastic deformation within the outer\nsurface region. Commercially, this is often\naccomplished by a process termed shot peening.\nSmall, hard particles (shot) having diameters\nwithin the range of 0.1 to 1.0 mm are projected at\nhigh velocities onto the surface to be treated. The\nresulting deformation induces compressive stresses\nto a depth of between one-quarter and one-half of\nthe shot diameter.",

If your answer was less than 1, read below. There are three things to be understood here :- 1. Liquid Shrinkage It refers to the reduction in volume when the metal changes from liquid state to solid state at the solidus temperature. The liquid shrinkage is rarely a problem, because the molten metal is continuously flowing in mold cavity and also riser to compensate the shrinkage of liquid in the cavity. 2. Solidification i.e Liquid to solid phase transformation (GCI expands in this process unlike other metals) So now during phase transformation gray cast iron expands (unlike other metals which contract) and there is no need of riser (used to take care of phase transformation shrinkage + liquid shrinkage). 3. Solid state Cooling (GCI contracts in this process just like other metals) It refers to the reduction in volume caused when metal loses temperature in solid state. To account for this, shrinkage allowance is provided on the patterns. The Shrinkage allowance depends primarily upon Coefficient of thermal expansion. For Grey CI in particular it is positive, it means solid grey cast iron expands on increasing temp and contracts on decreasing temperature just like any other metal. Adding all above factors Neglecting the Liquid shrinkage we see that GCI expands in during solidification and contracts when cooled in solid form. So the net result would be sum of them. According to NPTL in the table for GCI they have given the net value of shrinkage’s which is positive and hence the pattern size would be more than the casting. Note: The expansion of GCI during phase change (solidification) is a fact but at the same time we need to consider the contraction of GCI when cooling in solid state. So net result according to IISC and NPTEL is contraction so the size of pattern will be more than that of casting.",

Swell: This defect is found on the vertical surface of a casting if the moulding sand is deformed by the hydrostatic pressure caused by the high moisture content in the sand. Wash: A low projection on the drag surface of a casting commencing near the gate is called a wash. This is caused by erosion of sand due to the high velocity jet of liquid metal in bottom gating. Scab: This refers to the rough thin layer of a metal, protruding above the casting surface on the top of a thin layer of sand. The layer is held on the casting by a metal stringer through the sand.
