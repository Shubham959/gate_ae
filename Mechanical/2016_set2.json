If your answer was less than 1, read below. There are three things to be understood here :- 1. Liquid Shrinkage It refers to the reduction in volume when the metal changes from liquid state to solid state at the solidus temperature. The liquid shrinkage is rarely a problem, because the molten metal is continuously flowing in mold cavity and also riser to compensate the shrinkage of liquid in the cavity. 2. Solidification i.e Liquid to solid phase transformation (GCI expands in this process unlike other metals) So now during phase transformation gray cast iron expands (unlike other metals which contract) and there is no need of riser (used to take care of phase transformation shrinkage + liquid shrinkage). 3. Solid state Cooling (GCI contracts in this process just like other metals) It refers to the reduction in volume caused when metal loses temperature in solid state. To account for this, shrinkage allowance is provided on the patterns. The Shrinkage allowance depends primarily upon Coefficient of thermal expansion. For Grey CI in particular it is positive, it means solid grey cast iron expands on increasing temp and contracts on decreasing temperature just like any other metal. Adding all above factors Neglecting the Liquid shrinkage we see that GCI expands in during solidification and contracts when cooled in solid form. So the net result would be sum of them. According to NPTL in the table for GCI they have given the net value of shrinkage’s which is positive and hence the pattern size would be more than the casting. Note: The expansion of GCI during phase change (solidification) is a fact but at the same time we need to consider the contraction of GCI when cooling in solid state. So net result according to IISC and NPTEL is contraction so the size of pattern will be more than that of casting.",
