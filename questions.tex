\section*{Q1}
Given that the flow is incompressible.
[latex] \therefore \quad \mathrm{div}\,\bar{V}=0 [/latex]
[latex] \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(5+a_{1} x+b_{1} y\right)+\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left(8+a_{2} x+b_{2} y\right)=0 [/latex]
[latex] a_{1}+b_{2}=0 [/latex]
\section*{Q2}
Consider the two-dimensional velocity field  given by [latex]\overrightarrow{\mathrm{v}}=(5+a_{1}x+b_{1}y)\hat{i}\: + \:  (4+a_{2}x+b_{2}y)\hat{j}[/latex] ,where [latex]a_1,b_1,a_2 \text{ and }b_2[/latex]  are constants. Which one of the following conditions needs to be satisfied for the flow to be  incompressible?
